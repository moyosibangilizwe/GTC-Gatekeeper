## 📖 Overview
The **GTC Gatekeeper** framework shifts AI safety from voluntary "Soft Law" to the enforceable rigor of **Global Trade Compliance (GTC)**. By treating high-performance compute (HPC) as a physically monitorable precursor to frontier AI, this framework establishes a verifiable **Standard of Care** for the digital age.

## ✨ The Three Pillars of the Framework

### 1. The Physical Supply Chain Anchor
We shift the regulatory focus from intangible algorithms to the **physical hardware** (GPUs/TPUs) required to train them. If a cluster exceeds the **$10^{26}$ FLOPs** threshold, it triggers mandatory GTC oversight.

### 2. The Anti-Bystander Mandate
Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) are no longer "neutral pipes." This framework establishes a legal **Duty of Inquiry**, requiring providers to actively screen for "Safety-Critical Workloads" just as they do for money laundering or sanctioned entities.

### 3. Telemetry-Linked Compliance (TLC)
A "Compliance by Design" architecture where hardware telemetry verifies that compute is being used within the declared geographic and safety bounds.

## 🚩 Red Flag Checklist for GTC Practitioners
* [ ] **Identity Masking**: Customer uses shell companies or obfuscated billing to acquire H100/B200-class clusters.
* [ ] **Geographic Anomalies**: High-intensity compute requests originating from or routing through high-risk jurisdictions.
* [ ] **Workload Spikes**: Sudden, unexplained jumps in compute utilization consistent with large-scale model training.
* [ ] **Verification Refusal**: Customer denies access to basic workload telemetry or cluster architecture details.
